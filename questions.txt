1. What is CDN (Content Delivery Network)?
=> A CDN is a globally distributed network of servers that delivers web content (like JS files, CSS, images) to users based on their location.
=> CDN (Content Delivery Network) एक नेटवर्क होता है geographically distributed servers का, जो static content (जैसे JS files, CSS, images, videos) को तेज़ी से लोड करने में मदद करता है।

    * Main Benefits of CDN:
        * Fast content delivery (low latency)
        * Reduced load on the main server
        * Improved website performance
        * Cached content from nearest server location 


2. What is crossorigin?
=> The crossorigin attribute is used in HTML tags (like <script>, <img>, etc.) when you are loading resources from a different domain (a cross-origin). It tells the browser how to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and whether credentials (like cookies) should be included.

3. What is npm?
=> npm is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to install, update, and manage JavaScript packages or libraries.

4. What is package.json?
=> package.json is the configuration file used in a Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project (like name, version, description, etc.) and lists all the dependencies (libraries/packages) that your project needs.

5. What is package-lock.json?
=> This file records the exact versions of installed dependencies.
=> It ensures that the same versions are installed every time (helps in consistency across machines/environments).
=> Auto-generated when you run npm install.

6. What are Transitive Dependencies?
=> Transitive dependencies are the dependencies of your dependencies. For example, if you install a package like express, it may internally depend on other packages, which are automatically installed by npm.

7. What is caret ^ and tilde ~ in package.json?
=> 

8. In a project, how many package.json files do we have?
=> Our main project has one package.json.
=> But every installed dependency (inside node_modules) also has its own package.json.

9. Why is node_modules not pushed to GitHub?
=> The node_modules folder contains thousands of files and is often very large.
=> It is automatically recreated using package.json and package-lock.json via npm install.
=> Hence, it is ignored using .gitignore to keep the repository clean and lightweight.
